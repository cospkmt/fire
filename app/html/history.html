            <p class="lead">The St. Petersburg Fire Department became a paid force in 1907, after many years as a volunteer department. The first fire station in St. Petersburg is today the McNulty Building, (named for the department's second Fire Chief) and is now a historic office building in the heart of downtown. This building once housed St. Petersburg's first “fire trucks”; horse-drawn carriages. Today, St. Petersburg has 30 pieces of firefighting apparatus, 12 fire stations, and a force of 310 firefighters and paramedics.</p>
            <hr class="w-25">
            <p>In 1993, the St. Petersburg Fire Department changed its name to St. Petersburg Fire Rescue to better reflect the high volume of emergency medical services provided in addition to fire suppression activities. St. Petersburg Fire Rescue also provides specialized life safety services by staffing three specialty teams. The Technical Rescue Team is housed in our Northshore Fire Station and is outfitted to respond to elevated, below-grade, confined-space, and structural collapse rescues. The Hazardous Materials Team responds out of our Downtown Master Fire Station to spills and releases of toxic substances, liquids, or gases countywide. Our Dive and Marine Rescue Team, located at our Lakewood Fire Station, is staffed by certified rescue divers and responds to rescue victims of emergencies on St. Petersburg's many waterways.</p>
            <p>Our A, B and C shifts work 24-hours on duty and 48 hours off, and are managed by 6 District Chiefs. Each “DC” is responsible for a designated area of the City. Each shift also has 1 rescue lieutenant responding to complex medical calls, overseeing patient care.</p>
            <p>Our downtown Fire Headquarters building houses a heavy equipment repair shop, and offices for over 40 administrative personnel, including 5 Division Chiefs and the Fire Chief. Headquarters is also home to our Fire Inspectors, Public Educators, Training Coordinators, Accountants, Computer Services and Office Systems Specialists who work behind the scenes of St. Petersburg Fire Rescue. The headquarters building transforms into an Emergency Operations Center in times of crisis.</p>
            <p>St. Petersburg Fire Rescue protects the lives and property of over 260,000 residents and responds to over 40,000 emergency incidents annually.</p>

                    <p>The newly organized force was headed by G. W. Anderson. During his term, headquarters was moved first to Anderson's Meat Market and later to Fire Station No. 1, which was built in 1911, at Third Street and Second Avenue South. The first horse-drawn steam engine was purchased during this period. The horses, Dick and Dan, are mentioned often in remaining records. Following Chief Anderson's death in 1912, J. T. McNulty was appointed Chief and served until 1936. Two more stations were added by this time. The increased efficiency of the fire department was shown by a report that the fire loss in St. Petersburg was relatively small, considering the size of the town and the number of wooden buildings.</p>

                    <p>Chief McNulty was succeeded by A. H. Tuthill, who served until the appointment of Claude Nesbit. In 1939, the National Board of Fire Underwriters, in its first report since 1926, reported that an increase in manpower over the 46 man force was needed. New equipment was also identified as a necessity. Nesbit remained Chief until 1952.</p>

The position of Assistant Chief was filled by rotating various Deputy Chiefs through the office. Station #10 was built, more personnel were added to the training staff, and programs in civil preparedness and communications were set up.</p>
