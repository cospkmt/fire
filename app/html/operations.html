            <p class="lead"><strong>Update all stats on this page. </strong>These are just some of the possible emergency incidents that occur in St. Petersburg on any given day. Although we cannot prevent these emergencies, we can take steps to lessen their impact on individual citizens and the community as a whole. The division is responsible for the staffing, training, equipment, and supplies necessary to provide protection to the citizens and the community. Staffed with 310 professional firefighters, the Operations Division protects more than 250,000 customers across 60 square miles of St. Petersburg and at the same time staffs and operates 12 fire stations.</p>

            <p>All personnel hired since 1985 are required to maintain state certification as both firefighters and emergency medical technicians. Paramedics are also required to be state certified as firefighters. Company officers must have successfully completed seven college courses required for state certification as an officer. Officers and personnel of the Operations Division pride themselves on a proactive approach to fire prevention, public education, and emergency medical services while maintaining the highest degree of emergency preparedness.</p>
            <hr class="w-25">
            <h5>Stations</h5>
            <p>The division provides service from twelve stations strategically located through the district. Each station is managed by a fire captain who is responsible for the operation and maintenance of his/her respective facility. Due to the work schedule that covers the entire 24-hour period, all stations are equipped with kitchen and dormitory facilities. The Master Station is our largest station, housing two fire companies and two advanced life support (ALS) units. Stations 4, 9, and 11 all house two fire companies and an ALS unit. Stations 3, 6, 7, 8 and 10 are single company stations, each with an ALS unit. Stations 12, and 13 are all single engine companies providing ALS services.</p>

            <h5>Apparatus</h5>

There are nine pumpers capable of delivering 1250 gallons per minute (GPM), four 1500 GPM pumpers, and four 100-foot elevating platforms capable of delivering 1500 GPM each. Wild land fires are addressed by a brush truck that is a modular brush firefighting unit which can be hydraulically removed, freeing the truck for other fire department operations. In addition to the brush module, a stake bed body supports the Technical Rescue Team. Emergency scene power is provided by a squad unit with generator, lights, ventilation, and an air bottle re-filling station.</p>
